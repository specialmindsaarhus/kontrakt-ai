- ✅ Success animation (bouncy checkmark with elastic bounce)
- ✅ Error handling with Danish messages + retry
- ✅ Export to Word, PDF, Markdown (auto-open on button click)
- ✅ Auto-save settings (debounced)
- ✅ CLI provider detection (Claude Code, Gemini, OpenAI)
- ✅ **Gemini CLI integration** (stdin method, ~90 sec analysis)
- ✅ Complete document analysis workflow
- ✅ Multi-format report generation (PDF, DOCX, MD)
- ✅ Automatic file organization by client and date (DD-MM-YYYY format)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and debug logging
- ✅ **ESLint code quality checks** (catches scoping issues, undefined variables)

**Known Issues & TODO:**
- ✅ ~~Add ProviderSelector UI component~~ (COMPLETED 2025-12-18)
- ✅ ~~ESC key to cancel analysis~~ (COMPLETED 2025-12-18)
- 🎯 **NEXT:** Settings modal (hamburger menu implementation)
- ⚠️ Auto-start behavior (currently auto-starts, user requested to keep this)
- 📋 **Future:** Implement provider custom instructions (spec ready: specs/provider-custom-instructions.spec.md)
  - **Problem:** Development CLAUDE.md causes errors when Claude CLI reads it during analysis
  - **Solution:** Separate provider-configs/ directory for runtime analysis instructions
  - **Benefit:** Users can customize LLM behavior without modifying code
- 📋 **Future:** OpenAI CLI support
- 📋 **Future:** Settings UI for editing provider instructions
- 📋 **Future:** Manual start button (optional - user prefers auto-start)
- 📋 **Future:** Leverage Claude context bleed for personalized client analysis (chat feature)

## Project Overview

**Contract Reviewer** is an Electron desktop app that provides a GUI for reviewing franchise documents (contracts, manuals) using LLM CLI tools. Target user is a franchise consultant who needs professional, client-ready reports.

**Key Design Principles:**
- CLI-based (no API keys, leverages existing subscriptions)
- Local-first (client confidentiality, no cloud uploads)
- Multi-LLM support (Claude, Gemini*, OpenAI*)
- Professional output (PDF/Word reports)

*Future implementation

## Architecture

### System Layers

1. **CLI Layer** - Adapter pattern for multiple providers
2. **Prompt Layer** - 3 Danish system prompts
3. **Report Layer** - PDF/Word/Markdown generation
4. **Management Layer** - Settings, organization, logging
5. **Orchestration Layer** - Analysis runner (complete workflow)
6. **UI Layer** - Electron + React (complete)

### Data Flow

```
User drops document → Select prompt → Analysis Runner executes:
  1. Validate inputs
  2. Detect CLI
  3. Load prompt
  4. Execute CLI
  5. Generate reports (PDF/Word/Markdown)
  6. Organize output (client/date folders)
  7. Update settings
  8. Return results
```

## Important Implementation Notes

### Claude CLI Syntax

The actual Claude CLI syntax differs from initial assumptions:

**Correct Usage:**
```bash
claude --print --system-prompt "System prompt text" "User prompt with document content"
```

**Key Points:**
- NO `--files` flag - read file contents and pass as prompt text
- System prompt is passed as text, not file path
- Must use `--print` flag for non-interactive output
- Reference materials must be read and included in prompt

### Multi-CLI Integration

- Detect available CLIs: `which claude` / `which gemini` / `which openai`
- User must have at least one CLI installed
- Show only available CLIs in dropdown
- No API keys needed - leverages user's CLI subscriptions

### Report Generation

- PDF: Professional cover page, formatted content (pdfkit)
- Word: Editable DOCX with structured headings (docx package)
- Markdown: With metadata header for archiving
- All include branding, client name, date, document info

### Security & Privacy

- All processing happens locally (client confidentiality)
- No external API calls
- Clean up temporary files after processing
- Organized output by client/date for privacy

### Error Handling

- Danish error messages with recovery suggestions
- Common scenarios: CLI not found, auth required, file errors, timeout
- Graceful degradation (show raw output on parse errors)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Setup
npm install

# Development
npm run dev              # Vite dev server
npm run electron:dev     # Electron app with hot reload

# Code Quality (Run after making changes!)
npm run lint             # Check code with ESLint (catches scoping issues!)
npm run lint:fix         # Auto-fix simple ESLint issues

# Testing
npm run test:smoke       # Quick 30s validation (run after backend changes)
npm run test:integration # Full end-to-end test (run before commits)
npm test                 # Vitest unit tests

# Production
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run build:win       # Windows .exe installer
npm run build:mac       # macOS .dmg installer
```

## Quality Assurance

**ESLint Configuration:** `eslint.config.js`
- ✅ Catches undefined variables (prevents scoping bugs!)
- ✅ Warns on unused variables
- ✅ React/JSX support with hooks validation
- ✅ Configured for Node.js + Browser + Electron

**Pre-commit Hooks:** `.husky/pre-commit`
- ✅ Auto-runs ESLint before every commit
- ✅ Auto-runs smoke test before every commit
- ✅ Blocks commits if either fails
- ⚠️ Use `git commit --no-verify` only in emergencies

**Smoke Test:** `tests/smoke-test.js`
- ✅ 30-second full workflow validation
- ✅ Tests: file upload → analysis → report generation
- ✅ Catches runtime errors before they reach production

**Development Workflow:** See `DEV-WORKFLOW.md` and `CLAUDE-WORKFLOW.md`
- Comprehensive best practices
- Common error patterns to avoid
- Pre-commit checklist
- Refactoring safety guidelines

## Design System (Phase 6)

**Mockup:** `mockups/main-screen-v4.html`

**Colors:**
```css
--primary-dark: #0d1321;      /* Dark blue-tinted black */
--primary-accent: #2563eb;    /* Blue for selected states */
--success-green: #10b981;     /* Vibrant green for success */
--error-red: #dc2626;         /* Strong red for errors */
--background-light: #FAFAFA;  /* Light gray background */
```

**Typography:**
- Font: Inter (Google Fonts)
- Weights: 400 (regular), 500 (medium), 600 (semi-bold)
- Typography-led design (text does more work than boxes)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Light buttons with borders (reversed from dark outline)
- Solid borders with varying thickness for state (1px → 2px → 3px)
- Full-screen layout (no scrolling)
- Strategic color (neutral UI, color only for state)
- Lucide icons (professional SVG icons)

**Animations:**
- Checkmark pop: 600ms elastic bounce
- Progress bars: 400ms ease-out
- Button transitions: 400ms
- All defined in mockup

## User Workflow (Current)

1. **Drop document** → File zone shows checkmark
2. **Select prompt** → Button turns dark (selected)
3. **Auto-start analysis** → Spinner + progress bars (3 stages)
4. **Success animation** → Bouncy green checkmark
5. **Export reports** → Click Word/PDF/Markdown buttons
6. **Organized output** → `output/client-name/YYYY-MM-DD/`

**Current UX:** Analysis auto-starts when file + prompt selected (no "Run" button).
**Planned Change:** Manual Start button (user explicitly clicks to begin analysis).
